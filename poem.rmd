"The sun was shining on the sea,  
      Shining with all his might:  
He did his very best to make

In the realm where dreams are woven tight,  
And stars dance softly through the night,  
There lies a land of whispered tales,  
Where every heartbeat softly sails.  

In fields of gold and skies of blue,  
Where time's embrace feels ever true,  
A melody of hope resounds,  
As gentle breezes kiss the grounds.  

Oh, how the rivers softly flow,  
With secrets only they can know,  
And mountains stand, majestic, tall,  
Guardians of the land's sweet call.  

In every leaf, a story blooms,  
With fragrant scents and verdant plumes,  
And as the sun begins to set,  
The world in hues of fire is met.  

So let us wander hand in hand,  
Through this enchanted wonderland,  
For in this place, our souls are free,  
To dance with joy, eternally.
